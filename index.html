                        <p>I have Bachelor of Engineering in computer that has helped me to design and develop the application of computer systems. 
                            Since, majority of computers
                            are used as components within other systems such as audio-visual players,
                            the engine management systems, aircraft navigation systems, and automatic control systems.
                            Therefore, this programme has assisted me to produce skilled, qualified human resource that works for software
                            development, network design and implementation, hardware and software trouble shooting, network security policies, etc.
